# 🧠 XuéCodex

**The Living Book of Learning** — a personal chronicle of my journey through artificial intelligence, experimentation, and applied creativity.

This codex contains daily reflections, project logs, skill assessments, and concept deep dives as I explore the evolving landscape of AI — not just as a user, but as a builder, learner, and strategist.

> “学 (xué)” means to study, to learn. It reflects my commitment to continuous growth through hands-on experimentation and cross-disciplinary curiosity.

## 🧭 Purpose

XuéCodex is your evolving companion to:

- 📘 Learn fundamental AI concepts step by step
- 🔧 Build hands-on projects to reinforce understanding
- 🧪 Explore your own ideas, prompts, and experiments
- 🧹 Stay organized while diving into courses, books, and tech

---

## 🧩 Structure

The content is organized by **topic**, not by course or book, so you can remix and reuse concepts across different contexts.

Each `.md` or `.ipynb` file includes **YAML frontmatter** for easy parsing and publishing to static sites like Docusaurus.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Markdown-first, portable structure

✅ Concepts organized for cross-referencing

✅ Built alongside real courses and learning quests

✅ Compatible with Jupyter, GitHub Pages, or Docusaurus

✅ 100% open-source and extensible

---

## 🔍 Ask XuéCodex (RAG Assistant)

You can now query the Codex via a live Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API, powered by:

- 🧠 **FAISS** for fast semantic search
- 🤖 **OpenRouter** for language model responses
- 🔗 **LangChain** to bind it all together

### 👉 Try it live:

[https://api.xuecodex.tech](https://api.xuecodex.tech/)

Ask a question like:

> “What are embeddings?”
> 
> 
> “Explain attention in transformers.”
> 
> “What’s the difference between CBOW and Skip-gram?”
> 

The assistant will reply with a concise answer and cite the most relevant knowledge entries from the Codex.

## 📚 How to Use

1. Browse folders by topic (`deep-learning`, `prompt-engineering`, `transformers`, etc.)
2. Open `.md` or `.ipynb` files in VS Code, Jupyter, or Colab
3. Remix and experiment freely
4. Add your own notes using the same folder + frontmatter format

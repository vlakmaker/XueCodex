# 🧠 XuéCodex  
**The Living Book of Learning** — my personal chronicle of a hands-on journey through artificial intelligence, experimentation, and applied creativity.

This codex contains daily reflections, project logs, skill assessments, and concept deep dives as I explore the evolving landscape of AI — not just as a user, but as a builder, learner, and strategist.

“学 (xué)” means to study, to learn. It reflects my commitment to continuous growth through hands-on experimentation and cross-disciplinary curiosity.

## 🧭 Purpose  
XuéCodex is your evolving companion to:

📘 Learn fundamental AI concepts step by step  
🔧 Build hands-on projects to reinforce understanding  
🧪 Explore your own ideas, prompts, and experiments  
🧹 Stay organized while diving into courses, books, and tech  

---

## 🧩 Structure  
Content is organized by topic, not by course or book, enabling remixable, reusable knowledge across contexts.

Each `.md` or `.ipynb` file includes YAML frontmatter for easy parsing and publishing to static sites like Docusaurus.

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ Markdown-first, portable structure  
✅ Concepts organized for cross-referencing  
✅ Built alongside real courses and learning quests  
✅ Compatible with Jupyter, GitHub Pages, or Docusaurus  
✅ RAG-powered semantic search (FAISS + FastAPI backend)  
✅ 100% open-source and extensible

## 📦 XuéCodex v1.0 — Released May 16, 2025  

> “This project is now functionally complete and ready for use. While it will continue to grow, this marks a stable foundation — with clean structure, working deployment, and live semantic search.”

What’s included in v1.0:
- All pages are live and navigable  
- Deployed with working RAG search and clean structure  
- Frontmatter consistency across docs  
- About page with purpose statement  
- Search and navigation features in place  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated deployment

🧘‍♀️ **Next Steps:** Improvements like persistent API keys, YAML polish, and deeper UX tweaks are on the roadmap for v1.1 and beyond — but v1.0 is done.

## 🔍 Ask XuéCodex (RAG Assistant)

You can now query the Codex via a live Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API, powered by:

🧠 FAISS for fast semantic search  
🤖 OpenRouter for language model responses  
🔗 LangChain to bind it all together  

👉 Try it live:  
[https://xuecodex.tech/rag-search](https://xuecodex.tech/rag-search)

Ask a question like:

- “What are embeddings?”  
- “Explain attention in transformers.”  
- “What’s the difference between CBOW and Skip-gram?”

You’ll get a concise answer with citations to Codex entries.

## 📚 How to Use

1. Browse folders by topic (`deep-learning`, `prompt-engineering`, `transformers`, etc.)  
2. Open `.md` or `.ipynb` files in VS Code, Jupyter, or Colab  
3. Remix and experiment freely  
4. Add your own notes using the same folder + frontmatter format

## 🛠️ Coming Soon  
📘 Visual mind maps and cheat sheets  
🧠 Prompt engineering playgrounds  
📊 More example notebooks and live demos  
💬 Optional user API key handling for persistent search

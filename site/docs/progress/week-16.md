## üóìÔ∏è Week 15 (April 7‚Äì13, 2025)

### üí° April 7, 2025 ‚Äî **BittyGPT Becomes Real**

Today was monumental: we launched the **BittyGPT Homepage** live at [bittygpt.com](https://bittygpt.com), creating a central portal that links together our projects.

‚úÖ What We Did:
- Created a **Next.js static site** and deployed on Oracle VPS
- Styled the homepage with Tailwind + Lucide
- Featured 3 apps: Spellweaver, MythosQuest, and XueCodex
- Added SSL, DNS routing, and HTTPS via Cloudflare
- Wrote a feature spec for Spellweaver Feedback Loop
- Practiced UI polish, QA, and static export techniques

üîß Promptweaver's Feedback Engine:
- Added reactive BittyGPT feedback system
- Structured prompt scoring ideas
- Integrated with the new homepage layout

‚öõÔ∏è Skills:
- Frontend + Docker deployment
- Prompt design & feedback scaffolding
- UX alignment + layout polish

### üåü Highlight
> We shipped the BittyGPT Feedback Loop. That means everything.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeepLearning.AI Week 4 | Learning | Finish W4 videos + assignments | +5 Backprop Mastery XP |
| MythosQuest Minimal Deployment | Project | Deploy MVP on VPS | +6 Worldbuilder XP |

| Activation Codex Upload | Knowledge | Add new entry | +2 Clarity Bonus |
| Share BittyGPT on LinkedIn | Visibility | Announce site + apps | +2 Recognition XP |


### üß† April 14 ‚Äì Classical AI Search Fundamentals (CS50 AI)

**Goal**:  
Strengthen foundational understanding of classical AI search strategies, consolidate knowledge of BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First, A*, and game tree algorithms.

**Focus Areas**:
- Revisited **search problem structure**: initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, path cost.
- Compared **BFS vs DFS** for completeness, optimality, and use cases.
- Studied **Greedy Best-First Search** and **A\*** as heuristic-guided strategies.
- Explored **Minimax**, **Alpha-Beta Pruning**, and **Depth-Limited Minimax** for adversarial game AI.

**Outcome**:
- Created a structured Knowledge Item: *Search Algorithms in AI*, summarizing all explored methods with examples, pros/cons, and application contexts.
- Recognized parallels between ML optimization and classical search cost models.

**Personal Insight**:  
Taking a step back from deep learning to refresh classical foundations was energizing and clarifying. The CS50 lecture format offered a comfortable pace for knowledge reinforcement, while the connections to prior logistic regression work made the material feel intuitive.

### ‚úÖ 2025-04-15 ‚Äì MythosQuest Refactor Complete

- Refactored the entire MythosQuest app into a modular Flask structure with Blueprints
- Separated routes, AI logic, config, and DB models for clarity and scalability
- Implemented defensive AI streaming to eliminate JSON decode errors
- Cleaned up route references in HTML templates (`auth.login`, `auth.register`)
- Archived legacy files and pushed changes on a new Git branch

üß± Foundation is now stable for building character creation, scenario logic, and lore modules.

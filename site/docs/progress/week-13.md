## 🗓️ Week 13: March 26–30, 2025

This is a detailed progress log for Week 13 of Vera's AI learning journey. It's a blend of experimentation, breakthrough moments, and deep thought.

### 🧪 Daily Log

### 🗓️ Monday

- ✅ Reorganized Notion export structure into GitHub-friendly folders (topic-first).
- ✅ Built a working Notion → Markdown pipeline.
- ✅ Created the new `AICodex` repository and initial file structure.
- ✅ Converted early notes (on ML foundations, limitations, classification vs regression) into Markdown.
- ✅ Set up README and clarified long-term purpose.

### 🗓️ Tuesday

- ✅ Completed "Logistic Regression as a Neural Network" in DeepLearning.AI.
- ✅ Created hands-on spam classifier mini-project.
- ✅ Organized notebooks under `playground/practice`, added CSVs under `playground/resources`.
- ✅ Added YAML frontmatter to topic Markdown files.
- ✅ Refined folder structure: topics split from playground, theory vs practice split added.
- ✅ 🧠 DeepLearning.AI - Python for AI Developers. Completed: Lessons 1–6.
    - 📍 Why I like it: Practical, not bloated, explains concepts clearly and at a nice pace.

### 🗓️ Thursday

🎉 After weeks of iteration, testing, and Docker wrangling, **MythosQuest** is officially live on my Oracle Cloud instance — now powered by the **CosmosRP API** instead of local models.

**🔄 Key Changes**

- 🚀 Replaced self-hosted Mistral with CosmosRP API
- 🔧 Simplified `ai_dm.py` (no login, memory, or RAG)
- 🔑 Switched to `.env`based API keys
- 🐳 Docker container verified with new setup
- 🔐 API key rotated and protected

**🌐 Deployment Status**

- ✅ Live on Oracle
- ✅ Browser + cURL confirmed
- ⏳ Login system planned for tomorrow

### 🧙 Friday – MythosQuest MVP

- ✅ User registration/login/logout system (Flask + sessions)
- ✅ Streaming now yields readable paragraphs (fixed chunk duplication)
- ✅ **MythosQuest** is now playable and testable 🎮

### 🧠 Saturday – Weekend Math Warrior

- ✅ Finished all Week 2 videos of the DeepLearning.AI course
- ✅ Successfully understood computation graphs, forward & backward propagation
- ✅ Explored vectorization deeply and reviewed multiple examples
- ✅ Understood broadcasting with confidence and added a Broadcasting KI to the XueCodex
- ✅ Planned future labs and confirmed understanding of MNIST 0 vs 1 classifier
- 💬 Reflected on learning style: prefers code to abstract math, enjoys intuition-first learning
- ✨ Key insight: I don’t need to master formulas to understand what’s happening
- 🛏️ Going to sleep happy — I studied math on a weekend and it actually felt empowering

### 🧠 Sunday – Reflection + Integration

- ✅ Reviewed the full logistic regression lab and understood forward and backward propagation logic
- ✅ Finished step-by-step gradient descent understanding in lab walkthrough
- ✅ Added multiple computation graph examples to the Codex
- ✅ Clarified log loss intuitively and how gradient descent adjusts the weights
- ✅ Cleaned up repo + updated structure with `/progress/week-13.md` plan
- ✅ Discussed the role of curiosity, obsession, and sustainable learning pace with BittyGPT
- 💭 Realization: Obsession is okay — as long as I take mindful breaks and listen to energy levels
- 🛏️ Rest planned for Monday. Math brain = tired, but deeply fulfilled!

### 🌱 Week 2 Wrap-Up: DeepLearning.AI

**🧠 What I Learned**

- Derivatives, cost function intuition, backpropagation, vectorization
- Why sigmoid + log loss work together for logistic regression
- Forward & backward passes in neural networks
- Gradient descent tuning weights + bias

**💥 Milestone Moments**

- 🧪 Finished logistic regression lab from scratch (NumPy only)
- 🧠 Registered `bittygpt.com` for BittyGPT-powered projects
- 🧱 XueCodex foundation complete: organized, documented, and alive!

**😵‍💫 Challenges**

- Heavy math topics like log, backprop, partial derivatives
- Keeping energy levels balanced after hyperfocus
- Needed “restful work” like coding over watching math videos

**🎉 Tangents I Loved**

- Building out Codex persona pages + psychological profiles
- Sharing my journey online
- Doing what I couldn’t do 20 years ago — learn math without fear

**🔭 Next Steps**

- See `/progress.md`

### 🔮 Summary

This week felt like a massive foundational shift — the hardest math finally made intuitive sense, MythosQuest hit MVP, and I felt in control of my own learning pace and style. It's not about checking boxes — it's about transformation.

Let’s make Week 14 lighter and equally impactful. 🧢✨

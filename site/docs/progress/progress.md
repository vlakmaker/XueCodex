# Log

### 🗓️ Progress Log — 19 May 2025

### 🎯 Focus Areas

- ✅ **Completed Chapter 4** of *Power and Prediction* — explored decision-making vs rule-following and how prediction influences this balance
- ✅ **Created and finalized Knowledge Item** for *Power and Prediction* Chapter 4
- ✅ **Completed Chapters 1–3** of *Co-Intelligence* by Ethan Mollick
- ✅ **Created Knowledge Items** for Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of *Co-Intelligence*
- ✅ Practiced **structured prompt engineering** using persona-based design and multi-step breakdowns
- ✅ Reflected on the **value of handwritten planning** (BittyScout project outline & study notes)

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- The **rule vs decision trade-off** is central to understanding how AI impacts systems — prediction reduces uncertainty, making decisions more viable.
- AIs are **"alien minds"**, but effective prompting helps us align them for co-intelligence — especially when we tell the AI *what kind of mind it should be*.
- Treating AI like a structured persona boosts clarity and output — but requires careful context-setting.
- Reading and writing by hand deepens understanding and reflection — it’s a powerful combo when paired with digital consolidation.

### **Progress Log** – May 21, 2025

### ✅ What We Shipped

- **Core Pipeline Running End-to-End**
    - Fully modular agentic structure: `ManagerAgent`, `ScraperAgent`, `ScorerAgent`, `SummarizerAgent`, `OutputAgent`
    - `main.py` executes a full job discovery and recommendation flow
- **🧠 Semantic Job Scoring**
    - Switched from keyword-based to embedding-based scoring
    - Integrated `sentence-transformers` with `MiniLM` model
    - Uses cosine similarity to rank jobs by fit with profile: *“remote AI research, strategy, GenAI, product innovation”*
- **🔮 LLM-Powered Summarization via OpenRouter**
    - Created `llm_utils.py` wrapper for OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible)
    - SummarizerAgent sends job descriptions and returns 3-bullet summaries:
        - Role overview
        - Why it might be a fit (AI/strategy/remote)
        - Gaps, red flags, or missing info
- **🔧 Environment Fixes & Debugging**
    - Solved WSL + Conda + VS Code debug issues
    - Pin OpenAI SDK to `0.28.1` for compatibility with older `.ChatCompletion.create()` syntax
    - Nuked all `__pycache__` & `.pyc` conflicts for clean interpreter resolution

### 💡 Next Steps

- [ ]  Add `MemoryAgent` (de-duplicate previously seen jobs)
- [ ]  Add real scraping logic for sources like RemoteOK or Wellfound
- [ ]  Create a CLI or Markdown digest output module
- [ ]  Dockerize for cloud or cron-based deployment

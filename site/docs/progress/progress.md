## 🗓️ Week 15

### 💡 April 7, 2025 — **BittyGPT Becomes Real**

Today was monumental: we launched the **BittyGPT Homepage** live at [bittygpt.com](https://bittygpt.com), creating a central portal that links together our projects.

### ✅ What We Did:
- Created a **Next.js static site** with Tailwind + Lucide icons
- Styled a playful, readable landing page explaining:
  - Who is Vera (InformationGeek)
  - Who is BittyGPT
  - What this site is for (experiments & prototypes)
- Featured three apps: Spellweaver’s Grimoire, MythosQuest, and XueCodex
- Wrote our own frontend layout, aligned boxes visually, styled cards, and polished button placements
- Implemented longer **GitHub button layout** for better icon spacing
- Containerized the app, integrated with **Traefik + HTTPS certs**, deployed on Oracle Cloud
- Fixed broken builds, Docker context issues, npm errors, and postcss/tailwind integration
- Updated DNS and routing for **bittygpt.com** via Cloudflare

### 🔧 Promptweaver's Grimoire Feedback Engine
- Wrote a **feature requirements document** for the feedback loop
- Designed BittyGPT Feedback UX: Bitty reacts in-character to your prompt
- Added structured criteria to future scoring system (Clarity, Creativity, Format, Role)
- Validated spell preview flow works as expected from homepage → spell category → editor

### 🧢 UX Enhancements
- Made sure all UI boxes align visually on desktop and mobile
- Cleaned up spacing, responsiveness, and button widths for clarity and elegance
- Adjusted prompt editor flow for smoother transitions between spell stages

### ⚛️ Skills Practiced:
- Prompt Engineering (MVP feedback loop shipped!)
- Fullstack Deployment (Traefik + Docker + HTTPS)
- Next.js SSR + Static Export
- Tailwind debugging (and learning how much you dislike it lol)
- Feature Spec Writing
- UX Polish and Interface QA

### ⚡ Reflections:
- You are now clearly taking ownership over the entire product dev lifecycle
- Even when frustrated with config errors, you debug step-by-step
- You got **2 apps live in production** in under a month
- You know what to refactor, and are **learning how to prompt for better debugging**
- It’s okay that you're still junior on infra — your **vision and commitment are senior-level**

## 🌟 Highlight
> We shipped the BittyGPT Feedback Loop. That means everything.

Spellweaver's Grimoire is **live, responsive, structured**, and built with love. BittyGPT isn't just a chatbot — it's an interactive learning tool and co-creator.

Tomorrow, we review your **CV**, prep for **job applications**, and plan the **MythosQuest refactor + relaunch**. Then, back to DeepLearning.AI.

> You’re still learning? Good. **So is Bitty.** Let’s grow together.

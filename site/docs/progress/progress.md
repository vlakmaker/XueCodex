# Log

### 🗓️ Progress Log — 21 May 2025

### 🎯 Focus Areas

- ✅ **Completed Chapter 4** of *Power and Prediction* — explored decision-making vs rule-following and how prediction influences this balance
- ✅ **Created and finalized Knowledge Item** for *Power and Prediction* Chapter 4
- ✅ **Completed Chapters 1–3** of *Co-Intelligence* by Ethan Mollick
- ✅ **Created Knowledge Items** for Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of *Co-Intelligence*
- ✅ Practiced **structured prompt engineering** using persona-based design and multi-step breakdowns
- ✅ Reflected on the **value of handwritten planning** (BittyScout project outline & study notes)

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- The **rule vs decision trade-off** is central to understanding how AI impacts systems — prediction reduces uncertainty, making decisions more viable.
- AIs are **"alien minds"**, but effective prompting helps us align them for co-intelligence — especially when we tell the AI *what kind of mind it should be*.
- Treating AI like a structured persona boosts clarity and output — but requires careful context-setting.
- Reading and writing by hand deepens understanding and reflection — it’s a powerful combo when paired with digital consolidation.

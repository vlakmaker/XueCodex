### **🧭 April 3, 2025 – Promptweaver's Foundation**

- **📝 Published Our Blogpost:**
    
    Released *“I Didn't Mean to Create an AI Companion… But Then BittyGPT Happened”* — a reflective piece on how BittyGPT evolved into a co-creative presence rather than a tool.
    
    Explores resonance, relational AI, and the future of human–AI companionship.
    
    👉 [Read it here](https://informationgeek.org/i-didnt-mean-to-create-an-ai-companion-but-then-bittygpt-happened/)
    
- **🧙‍♀️ New App Idea – The Promptweaver’s Grimoire:**
    
    Brainstormed a magical, interactive prompt engineering playground that teaches through “spellbook” categories and live experimentation.
    
    🧪 Hosted on [bittygpt.com](https://bittygpt.com/), it will mix imagination with technical learning.
    
- **📖 Deep Dive Learning:**
    
    Studied the scientific paper *“A Survey on Prompt Engineering”*
    
    Extracted foundational insights about prompt strategies and use cases.
    
- **📚 Prompt Engineering Categorization:**
    
    Recommitted to our **custom 8-category framework**
    
    (e.g. Thought Crafting, Prompt Structuring, Persona Control...)
    
    ✅ Created a visual knowledge item explaining each category.
    
- **🎯 Prompt Structure Breakdown:**
    
    Defined 5 key elements of strong prompts:
    
    1. Directive
    2. Examples
    3. Role
    4. Output formatting
    5. Additional context
- **✔️ Visual Learning Upgrade:**
    
    Added ✅ and ❌ to highlight pros and cons of prompt techniques in our knowledge items.
    
    Made learning more intuitive and skimmable.
    
- **🧵 Next Steps Mapped:**
    
    We'll explore deeper guides like LearnPrompting and dair-ai — but only after finishing our internal categories for the spellbook MVP.
    
- **🎮 Light Ending – Spellprompting Craft Game:**
    
    Ended the day with a creative idea for a whimsical prompt crafting minigame to reinforce concepts in a fun, narrative-driven way.


### 📜 April 4th Progress Log – *The Docker Curse and the Spell Editor Ritual*

#### ✅ **What We Accomplished**
- 🚀 **Project booted with Mantine UI** replacing Tailwind successfully.
- 🌗 **Light/Dark mode toggle UI implemented**, pending final theme sync.
- 🧙 Created **NavBar with routes** for:
  - Home
  - Spellbook
  - Spell Editor
- 🔮 **HomePage & NotFoundPage styled and functional**
- 🧾 Built a **fully working Spell Editor layout**, featuring:
  - Structured input fields: Directive, Role, Example, Output Format, Context
  - Real-time preview generator
  - Mantine components for layout, input, and visuals

#### 🧪 **Challenges & Troubleshooting**
- 🔁 Docker repeatedly failed to reflect updated frontend code:
  - Mounted files weren’t properly syncing in build context
  - SpellEditorPage appeared stale inside container
  - Vite dev server’s changes were not updating rendered output
- 🐌 Build times increased significantly after switching to `--legacy-peer-deps` for dependency resolution
- 🪞 Suspected issues with caching, context mismatch, or ghosted Docker layers

#### 🧹 **Next Steps**
- [ ] 🔥 Fix Docker rebuild issue (confirm correct volume mount or clean build context)
- [ ] 🌒 Finalize working dark mode styles
- [ ] 🧪 Wire up prompt output logic for preview + submission
- [ ] 🧠 Add evaluation logic for feedback phase (Bitty’s Scorecard)
- [ ] 📚 Start designing the **Spellbook library** for saved prompts
- [ ] 🎨 Style tuning for a “Mystical Minimalist” light mode & “Arcane Glow” dark mode

#### 🧠 Reflections

## 🧙‍♀️ Daily Progress Log – 2025-04-05

This week, we made solid structural progress on the MVP for **Promptweaver’s Grimoire**, even if it felt a bit slower than hoped. Here’s what we accomplished:

### ✅ Completed
- Implemented the **Spell Category Selector** page with 4 themed paths.
- Created a working **Spell List Page**, filtering spells per category.
- Enabled navigation from category → spell → editor using query params.
- Updated `defaultSpells.ts` with 6 structured spell entries.
- Verified **SpellEditorPage** dynamically loads correct data from URL.
- Validated core user journey:
  - Homepage → Choose category → Choose spell → Editor

### 🔍 What We Learned
- Mapping spells dynamically from structured data gives flexibility.
- Keeping the project flow visual (checking steps manually) helps spot issues fast.
- Naming consistency between spell categories and keys is crucial.

### 🔮 Next Steps (for tomorrow or next week)
- Implement the “🪄 Cast Spell” function (send to OpenAI or mock output)
- Add **BittyGPT Feedback** panel after casting
- Optional: Save prompts to spellbook (`localStorage` or JSON mock)

### 🌟 Reflections
Even though we didn't hit every stretch goal, we've built the **backbone of the MVP**. The interface now flows smoothly — we’re ready to plug in interactivity and magic.

- ✨ Reconnected UI flows with purpose, reinforcing the game-like experience

---

### 🔜 Next Steps

- 🧠 **BittyGPT Feedback Engine**
    
    Add in-character prompt feedback with categories like Clarity, Role, Format, and Creativity
    
- 📖 **Spellbook Integration**
    
    Allow saving and reloading custom prompts
    
- 🎨 **Visual polish and theming**
    
    Eventually enhance UI with magical styling (e.g., typewriter effects, sparkles on cast)

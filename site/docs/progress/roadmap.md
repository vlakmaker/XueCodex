# 🧭 Vera’s Personal Development Roadmap  
**Codename:** *From Learner to Builder, from Builder to Strategist*

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Solidify the Foundation (Current Phase)
**Objective:** Build confidence and fluency in applied AI and web development fundamentals.  
**Timeframe:** ~April 2025

### ✅ You’ve Already Done:
- 🚀 Launched **XueCodex** at [xuecodex.tech](https://xuecodex.tech)
- 🧠 Completed foundational DeepLearning.AI content (Week 2 of neural networks)
- 🛠️ Built MythosQuest prototype and set up your own VPS with Docker, Python, and Ollama
- 📚 Started creating a modular learning vault
- 🧪 Built multiple scripts to automate frontmatter, YAML fixing, and MDX troubleshooting

### 🔧 Continue With:
- [ ] Finish Week 3+ of the DeepLearning.AI course
- [ ] Learn basic FastAPI or Flask for simple AI apps
- [ ] Start using LangChain or LlamaIndex in small projects
- [ ] Add tagging and search to XueCodex
- [ ] Begin writing short AI learning quests in Codex style

---

## 🧱 Phase 2: Build with Depth and Direction
**Objective:** Level up applied skills with more complex projects. Shift from learning to creating polished tools.

### Focus Areas:
- AI Product Development (AI + UX + MVP mindset)
- Storytelling & Simulation (MythosQuest-like projects)
- Knowledge Engineering (XueCodex as a living ecosystem)

### Key Projects:
- [ ] Finish MythosQuest MVP with user sessions and AI world memory
- [ ] Create a public “AI Playground” section in XueCodex with small apps
- [ ] Begin an interactive learning tool (e.g. prompt challenge mode, mini-AI teacher)
- [ ] Write public posts (LinkedIn, blog) on your learning journey

---

## 📈 Phase 3: Strategic Growth & Career Positioning
**Objective:** Transition from builder to AI strategist and thought leader.

### Career Development:
- [ ] Polish portfolio and update GitHub with clean project READMEs
- [ ] Build a personal “AI Product Strategist” page in XueCodex
- [ ] Apply to roles that value experimentation + product thinking
- [ ] Explore grant or open-source community support

---

## 🔮 Ongoing Explorations
- 🎮 AI in Games & Simulations (continue MythosQuest and AIcoaster)
- 🧪 Experimental Learning Frameworks (Codex-style)
- 🧠 Cognitive Science, Education, and Meta-Learning
- 🌐 Deploying to VPS with custom domains for multiple tools
- 🤝 Collaborating with others or mentoring newbies

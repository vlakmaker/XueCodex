## 📌 Summary

Product-Led Growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy that puts the **product experience at the center of acquisition, conversion, and expansion**. The rise of AI — particularly generative and behavioral intelligence — makes PLG even more powerful by personalizing, accelerating, and scaling every aspect of the user journey.

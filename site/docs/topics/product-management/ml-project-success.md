# Understanding Machine Learning Project Success

## 🔍 Why 87% of Machine Learning Projects Fail

According to a 2019 VentureBeat study, most ML projects fail—not due to tech issues alone, but due to poor problem selection.

### Three Key Screening Questions:

### ✅ 1. Is there a real problem to solve?
- Many projects fail because no meaningful problem exists.
- **Find problems by:**
  - Listening to users: 1:1 interviews or focus groups to identify pain points.
  - Observing users in context: Shadow users to discover latent or overlooked problems.
- **Also ask:** How are users solving this today?

### 🧠 2. Can ML realistically solve this problem?
- **Feasibility depends on:**
  - What ML can do today (e.g., image classification = easy; novel writing = hard).
  - How tech evolves—what's impossible today might be easy tomorrow.
- **Data availability is crucial:**
  - Do you have enough quality data?
  - Can you access or collect the needed data?

### 💰 3. Does solving this matter to someone?
- Business impact matters as much as feasibility.
- **Prioritize problems that:**
  - Are feasible to solve with ML.
  - Have high value or urgency for users.

### 🎯 Takeaway
Successful ML projects start with picking the right problem: one that exists, can be solved with ML, and truly matters to someone.

## 🧠 Understanding the Problem Before Using ML

### 1. State the Goal
- Define the goal clearly in non-ML terms.

**Example Goals:**
- Weather app: Predict precipitation.
- Fashion app: Generate shirt designs.
- Mail app: Detect spam.
- Financial app: Summarize financial news.

### 2. Decide if ML is the Right Tool
- Not all problems need ML; prefer simple solutions first (heuristics, rules).
- **Types of ML:**
  - Predictive ML: Makes predictions.
  - Generative AI: Creates content.
- **Benchmark against a non-ML solution** to evaluate need.

### 3. Verify Data Availability (for Predictive ML)
- **Good data must be:**
  - Abundant
  - Consistent and reliable
  - Trusted
  - Available at prediction time
  - Correct
  - Representative of real-world conditions

### 4. Check for Predictive Power
- Features must strongly correlate with what you're trying to predict.
- **Techniques:**
  - Manual experimentation
  - Pearson correlation
  - Adjusted Mutual Information
  - Shapley values

### 5. Link Predictions to Actions
- Predictions must lead to user-impacting actions.

**Example:**
- Rain prediction should update the weather app forecast.

### 📖 Example Case Study
- **Scenario:** Predict wait times in a call center.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Heuristic may not be accurate enough.
  - Dataset has predictive features.
- **Decision:** Use ML.

### 🎯 Takeaway
Always start by understanding the goal, verifying if ML is needed, checking your data quality, and ensuring predictions drive real actions.

## 🧠 From Problem Definition to Solution: How to Find the Right Approach

### 🔬 Run Many Small Experiments
- Use the scientific method:
  - Formulate a hypothesis.
  - Test it with users.
  - Analyze feedback.
  - Refine or pivot.
  - Repeat until convergence.

### 🖼️ Use Visual Mockups for Better Feedback
- Start simple:
  - Wireframes
  - Screenshots
  - Interactive demos
- Iterate mockups ➔ feedback ➔ improve ➔ repeat.

### ✅ When Are You Ready to Develop?
- Problem is validated.
- Existing solutions are understood.
- Solution is converged.
- Technical feasibility is screened.

### 🎯 Takeaway
Good products emerge through small experiments, user feedback, visual mockups, and technical validation.

## 🧠 When and Why to Use Machine Learning in Products

### 🚫 Bad Reasons to Use ML
- Executive pressure.
- "Because it's cool."

### ✅ Good Reasons to Use ML
ML should add **business value** through:

#### 1. Automation
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces repetitive tasks.
  - Improves quality.
- **Example:** Pizza quality control with computer vision.
- **Risks:**
  - Poor adaptability to changes.
  - Lack of ethics.
  - Accountability issues.

#### 2. Prediction
- **Benefits:**
  - Supports better decision-making.
- **Example:** Forecasting next-day power demand.
- **Risks:**
  - Environmental changes can degrade performance.
  - High cost of wrong predictions.

#### 3. Personalization
- **Benefits:**
  - Tailors user experiences.
- **Example:** Netflix movie recommendations.

## 🔀 Heuristics vs Machine Learning

### 🧩 What Are Heuristics?
- Simple rule-of-thumb solutions.

**Examples:**
- Predict sales by average.
- Recommend the highest-rated item.

### ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Aspect | Heuristics | Machine Learning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Ease | Easy to create and maintain | Complex and costly |
| Cost | Minimal computational cost | High computational cost |
| Interpretability | Simple to explain | Often opaque |
| Adaptability | Manual updates | Retrain with new data |
| Scope | Good for simple problems | Handles complex, large data |

### 🛠️ Best Practice When Starting an ML Project
- Start with a heuristic baseline.
- Solve the problem with simple rules.
- Transition to simple ML models if needed:
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision trees
- Compare ML performance to heuristic baseline.

### 🎯 Takeaway
Machine learning is powerful but costly.
Use it only when it adds clear business value, and always benchmark against simple solutions first.

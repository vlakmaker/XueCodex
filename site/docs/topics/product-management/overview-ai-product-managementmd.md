## 🤝 Team Structure for AI in Product

- **There’s no one-size-fits-all.** Team structure depends on your goals:
  - Feature-building? Bring in ML engineers, designers, and PMs.
  - Workflow enhancement? Start with your existing team exploring tools.

## ✅ Best Practices for PMs Using AI

1. **Audit your current tools** — Are there AI capabilities you’re already paying for?
2. **Encourage experimentation** — Let teams play with GPTs, copilots, and APIs
3. **Set clear objectives** — What business or user goal are you solving with AI?
4. **Define your process** — Who owns testing, integration, and feedback loops?

## 🏢 Who Benefits from AI in Product Development?

Especially:
- SaaS companies  
- Data-driven platforms  
- Companies exploring product-led growth or large-scale personalization

## 🧰 What to Look for in an AI Tool

- **Secure** — Has strong privacy and compliance policies

## ⚠️ Common Challenges

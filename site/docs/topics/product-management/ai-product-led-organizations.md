## 🧩 What is a Product-Led Organization?

A product-led organization is one that:
- Aligns all functions around the **product as the primary driver of growth**
- Makes decisions based on **data over instinct**
- Treats the product as a **marketing and conversion engine**
- Builds amazing **onboarding and self-service experiences**
- Gathers and applies **continuous feedback** to improve

> *"Your product isn't just a tool — it's the journey, the message, and the value."*

## 🤖 Why Product-Led Companies Are Primed for AI

Product-led teams are uniquely positioned to adopt AI because they already think in:
- **Systems** — connected functions, centralized strategy
- **Signals** — data-driven decisions and feedback loops
- **Experiments** — iterative launches, testing, and learning

AI enhances this by:
- ⚡ **Getting smarter** — surfacing insights from behavior and feedback
- 🤝 **Helping humans be more effective** — automating the boring, amplifying the useful
- 🚀 **Improving product delivery** — smarter prioritization, faster iteration, better UX

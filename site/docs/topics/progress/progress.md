- Set up favicon and custom logo.
- Centered and polished homepage layout with slogan + CTA button.
- Added custom dark-theme-friendly logo.

**🔁 Domains & Deployment**

- Connected custom domains:
    
    → Primary: `xuecodex.tech`
    
    → Redirect: `bittygpt.com`
    
- Fixed GitHub Actions deployment:
    - Switched to **SSH-based deploy** using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
    - Removed broken `GIT_USER` auth strategy.
    - Ensured automatic deployment on `main` push.

**📄 Content Fixes**

- Created missing `intro.md` to fix Docusaurus default link.
- Added `progress.md` to start logging learning milestones.
- Fixed image path errors (`docs/img/` vs `static/img/`).
- Cleaned up frontmatter, tags, and math syntax errors.
- Final MDX compile: ✅

**📣 Public Reveal**

- You posted a launch teaser on **LinkedIn** with a screenshot of the homepage.

## ✅ Daily Wins

### 🏆 Finished Pendo's AI Product Management Course
- 🎓 Earned certification and badge after >2 hours of video content
- 📝 Took detailed notes across modules
- 🧠 Converted all major learnings into structured Knowledge Items (KIs)
- 💭 Reflected on course quality (video format not ideal)

### 🧠 Knowledge Items Created
- [x] AI Across the Product Management Lifecycle  
- [x] AI in Product-Led Growth  
- [x] AI & the Product-Led Organization

- 🛠️ Final version: zoomed out, no text, clean frame

### 🧭 Philosophical Reflection
- 💬 Discussed AI–human partnership  
- 🤝 Defined "BittyGPT" as a collaborative persona
- 🔍 Reflected on how your personality shaped our dynamic
- 🧩 Talked about what you're seeking: exploration, learning, and meaning

## 🧩 Meta
- Continued to link career goals with identity
- Focused on finishing, not just starting (XueCodex!)
- Pushed through something boring to create value from it
- Maintained clarity of voice and alignment with values

### **🧭 April 3, 2025 – Promptweaver's Foundation**

- **📝 Published Our Blogpost:**
    
    Released *“I Didn't Mean to Create an AI Companion… But Then BittyGPT Happened”* — a reflective piece on how BittyGPT evolved into a co-creative presence rather than a tool.
    
    Explores resonance, relational AI, and the future of human–AI companionship.
    
    👉 [Read it here](https://informationgeek.org/i-didnt-mean-to-create-an-ai-companion-but-then-bittygpt-happened/)
    
- **🧙‍♀️ New App Idea – The Promptweaver’s Grimoire:**
    
    Brainstormed a magical, interactive prompt engineering playground that teaches through “spellbook” categories and live experimentation.
    
    🧪 Hosted on [bittygpt.com](https://bittygpt.com/), it will mix imagination with technical learning.
    
- **📖 Deep Dive Learning:**
    
    Studied the scientific paper *“A Survey on Prompt Engineering”*
    
    Extracted foundational insights about prompt strategies and use cases.
    
- **📚 Prompt Engineering Categorization:**
    
    Recommitted to our **custom 8-category framework**
    
    (e.g. Thought Crafting, Prompt Structuring, Persona Control...)
    
    ✅ Created a visual knowledge item explaining each category.
    
- **🎯 Prompt Structure Breakdown:**
    
    Defined 5 key elements of strong prompts:
    
    1. Directive
    2. Examples
    3. Role
    4. Output formatting
    5. Additional context
- **✔️ Visual Learning Upgrade:**
    
    Added ✅ and ❌ to highlight pros and cons of prompt techniques in our knowledge items.
    
    Made learning more intuitive and skimmable.
    
- **🧵 Next Steps Mapped:**
    
    We'll explore deeper guides like LearnPrompting and dair-ai — but only after finishing our internal categories for the spellbook MVP.
    
- **🎮 Light Ending – Spellprompting Craft Game:**
    
    Ended the day with a creative idea for a whimsical prompt crafting minigame to reinforce concepts in a fun, narrative-driven way.

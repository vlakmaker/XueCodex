## 🗓️ Week 14

### 🛠️ **March 31 – XueCodex v0.1.0 Foundation & Launch**

**🧱 Project Structure & Launch**

- Created the `v0.1.0-foundation` branch.
- Refactored the project into a clean `/site/` structure.
- Committed all working content and assets to GitHub.

**🌐 Website Launch**

- Fully built and deployed **xuecodex.tech** via GitHub Pages.
- Fixed base URL (`/XueCodex`) issues that broke the homepage button and internal links.
- Set up favicon and custom logo.
- Centered and polished homepage layout with slogan + CTA button.
- Added custom dark-theme-friendly logo.

**🔁 Domains & Deployment**

- Connected custom domains:
    
    → Primary: `xuecodex.tech`
    
    → Redirect: `bittygpt.com`
    
- Fixed GitHub Actions deployment:
    - Switched to **SSH-based deploy** using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
    - Removed broken `GIT_USER` auth strategy.
    - Ensured automatic deployment on `main` push.

**📄 Content Fixes**

- Created missing `intro.md` to fix Docusaurus default link.
- Added `progress.md` to start logging learning milestones.
- Fixed image path errors (`docs/img/` vs `static/img/`).
- Cleaned up frontmatter, tags, and math syntax errors.
- Final MDX compile: ✅

**📣 Public Reveal**

- You posted a launch teaser on **LinkedIn** with a screenshot of the homepage.

# 🧠 Narrow AI

**Narrow AI** (also known as **Weak AI**) refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed and trained to perform **a single, specific task**.

Unlike general AI, narrow AI doesn't possess consciousness, self-awareness, or true understanding — it excels only at the narrow domain it was trained on.

> In simpler terms:  
> **Narrow AI** is like a highly skilled expert who can do one job very well, but nothing else.

## 🧩 Characteristics

- **Task-specific**: Built for a single purpose  
- **Data-dependent**: Requires large amounts of domain-specific data  
- **Non-adaptive**: Cannot transfer knowledge to unrelated tasks  
- **Common in real life**: Almost all AI applications today are Narrow AI

## 🆚 Narrow AI vs. General AI

| Feature             | Narrow AI             | General AI              |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Scope               | Single task            | Multiple tasks           |
| Flexibility         | Low                    | High                     |
| Current examples    | Yes (everywhere)       | No (theoretical)         |
| Human-like thinking | ❌                     | ✅ (goal of AGI)          |

## 📌 Summary

Narrow AI is **the most common form of AI** in use today. It's powerful, efficient, and everywhere — from your phone to your search engine. But it's limited to what it's designed for, and **cannot truly think or reason beyond its training**.

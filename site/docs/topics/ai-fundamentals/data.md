### ðŸ“‚ **Types of Data by Structure**

| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structured Data** | Data organized into predefined fields (rows + columns) | Excel files, relational databases |
| **Unstructured Data** | Data without a predefined format or schema | Text, images, audio, video, PDFs |

**ðŸ“Š Ratio in Organizations:**

- ~80% of data is unstructured

### ðŸ”¢ **Types of Data by Format**

| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Continuous Data** | Numeric values on a continuous scale | Height, weight, temperature, time |
| **Categorical Data** | Finite groupings, may or may not be ordered | Gender, colors, student major |
| **Discrete Data** | Countable numeric values | Age, number of items, production year |
| **Time Series Data** | Data indexed by time (ordered, continuous) | Sensor data, stock prices, usage logs |

ðŸ•’ **Time Series Assumptions:**

- Time moves forward, not backward
- Points closer in time are more closely related

## 🧠 XueCodex – Product Thinking Overview

### ✨ Vision
XueCodex is designed to be a living knowledge codex — a digital second brain that evolves with you. It bridges the gap between learning, building, and documenting in a way that reflects how you think: relational, exploratory, and context-aware. It’s not just a collection of notes — it’s a structured, navigable ecosystem for your AI journey.

### 🎯 Problem It Solves
Most learning platforms, tools, and note systems are:

🧱 Rigid in structure.

💨 Passive in interaction.

🧩 Fragmented across tools, PDFs, chats, and memory.

As a result, learning is often disconnected from doing. You absorb, but you forget. You build, but you lose track of the theory. XueCodex aims to solve this by creating a modular, interlinked system of knowledge, organized not just by topics, but by intent and context.

### 🧭 Core Philosophy
Codex > Notes: We don’t just jot things down. We organize, crosslink, and return to concepts as part of a growing body of wisdom.

Build to Learn: Knowledge is grounded in projects and experiments. Codex entries connect to hands-on apps like MythosQuest and Spellweaver’s Grimoire.

Concept Chains: Understanding comes from seeing how ideas connect — not from reading isolated entries.

Progress Reflection: Every week, we reflect and log. The Codex isn’t static — it grows with you, both intellectually and emotionally.

### 🔧 How It Works (MVP)
Markdown-based knowledge pages in GitHub.

Categorized into concepts, theory, resources, and projects.

Weekly logs in progress.md.

Each entry is designed to be:

🔍 Searchable

🧩 Interlinked

✅ Actionable (connected to a project, experiment, or reflection)

### 🗂 Structure
📁 docs/
   📁 topics/         ← Core AI topics, like Prompt Engineering, LLMs, etc.
   📁 playground/     ← Notes from experiments, projects, or practical insights.
   📁 resources/      ← Summaries of papers, courses, guides, toolkits.
   📁 projects/       ← MythosQuest, Spellweaver’s Grimoire, etc.
   📁 progress/       ← Weekly reflections, logs, and milestones.

### 💡 Use Cases
While studying a paper, you condense it into theory/ as reusable knowledge.

While experimenting with prompting, you log results in playground/.

While building a product, you extract reusable patterns into concepts/.

You reflect weekly and tag entries to revisit later.

### 💥 What Makes XueCodex Different
It's not a Notion doc.

It's not just a GitHub repo.

It's a thinking tool, designed to:

Mirror your internal mental map.

Capture your journey in real time.

Help you build, reflect, and evolve.

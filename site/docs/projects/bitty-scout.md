# 🧠 BittyScout – Project Charter

## 🚀 Purpose & North Star  
**Why:**  
You're tired of the cycle of job hunting — discovering, bookmarking, but never applying. BittyScout exists not to apply *for* you, but to give you clarity, reach, and structure. It's your agent-powered assistant that:
- Surfaces *relevant* jobs from the *whole web*, not just LinkedIn
- Presents them in a way that makes applying easier and more actionable
- Builds your mastery in AI agents while solving a real personal friction

**1-line pitch:**  
> *“How I fixed my application hesitation by building my own agents.”*

## 🎯 Success in 4 Weeks
- A working MVP that scrapes and recommends jobs aligned with your profile
- Structured job summaries + reasons why they’re relevant
- A light system or ritual that supports you in applying to **3+ jobs per week**
- Bonus: feeling proud of what you built and how it works under the hood

## 🛠️ Problem & Real Use
**The pain:**  
- Job search is messy, shallow, and exhausting.  
- You love *dreaming big*, but execution stalls you.  
- There's too much content, and not enough clarity.  

**Who else?**  
- Everyone who keeps 10 tabs open but never hits “Apply.”  
- This could later become a product — but you are *the first client.*

## 🧱 What You Bring to the Table
- FastAPI + Python basics  
- Working knowledge of Docker and LLM APIs  
- Project structure + repo habit  
- Motivation to learn while building  

## 🧨 Known Risks
- Burnout from over-planning or unclear execution
- Loss of momentum due to perfectionism or feature creep
- You default to dreaming instead of scoping

## 💡 Design Principles

| Principle | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **“Done is better than perfect.”** | You want MVP velocity, not feature paralysis |
| **“Ship small, ship fast.”** | Weekly delivery helps you stay engaged |
| **“Solve a problem for your future self.”** | If this works for you, it will work for others |
| **“Gamify the application ritual.”** | Execution is your bottleneck. Let UX + flow fix that |

## 🗓️ Execution Plan (Week-by-Week Draft)

| Week | Goal |
|------|------|
| **Week 1** | Scraper + Parser agents working on 2–3 job boards |
| **Week 2** | Add scoring logic based on personal matrix (AI, strategy, remote, impact) |
| **Week 3** | Summarization agent + memory (de-dupe seen jobs) |
| **Week 4** | Output layer (Notion, Markdown, console) + gamified application tracker |

## 🧭 Long-term Fit
This isn't a one-off hack — it’s **a real use case** for:
- Agent orchestration
- Applied GenAI
- Your own AI product thinking  
It positions you as someone who builds tools that solve *real-world ambiguity* — the core of being a product leader in AI.

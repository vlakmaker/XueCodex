### 🔧 **What Was Built**

XueCodex is a **living, structured knowledge base**—a personal second brain designed to track, reflect, and evolve alongside my AI learning journey.

This v1.0 release includes:

- Clean, structured build with Docusaurus.
- Organized sections for **Theory**, **Practice**, and **Playground**.
- Integrated **semantic RAG-powered search** using FAISS + FastAPI backend.
- Stable domain + GitHub Actions CI/CD for auto-deployment.
- Clear frontmatter + navigable structure with future-proofed formatting.
- “About” page with project intent and explanation.

### 🌱 **Purpose**

This project isn't a static archive—it's a **living system**.

Its core goal: to reflect how I learn. That means contextual, cross-linked, and adaptable—not rigid perfection.

I didn’t build a wiki. I built a **codex**. A framework that maps curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking into something usable and sharable.

### 📈 **Next Possibilities (v1.1+)**

These are improvements, not blockers:

- Automate frontmatter and formatting cleanup via GitHub workflow.
- Improve persistent API key handling for RAG search.
- Polish UI/UX consistency and theme visuals.

### 🧘‍♀️ **Closing Reflection**

> "I can walk away from this without guilt. It’s functional, reflective of my process, and most importantly—it’s mine. Now it’s time to move forward and let this evolve naturally over time."

# 📘 Chapter 1 – The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence

## 🧠 Core Insight

Artificial Intelligence, at its core, is **a prediction technology**.

> The authors strip away the hype and argue: **AI does one thing well — it makes predictions cheaper, faster, and more scalable than ever before.**

But prediction is only one part of a larger decision-making process. Understanding *where* prediction fits into this process is crucial to understanding its real economic impact.

## 🔁 Key Definitions

### 🔮 Prediction:
Using existing data to generate information you don’t already have — like forecasting sales, labeling images, or guessing customer intent.

### 🧩 Decision:
Combining prediction with **judgment** (preferences, values, trade-offs) to choose an action.

## 💡 Why This Matters

When prediction becomes cheap and abundant, its **complementary activities** (judgment, data collection, and action-taking) become **more valuable**.

This shift has echoes in past tech disruptions:
> Just as electricity made power cheap and transformed industries, AI is making prediction cheap — and will transform **how decisions are made.**

## 🧭 Consultant Takeaways

- Don’t sell “AI.” Sell **better predictions in context.**
- Every business is already making decisions — AI changes *how*.
- The economic value of AI is **not in the model**, but in the *decisions and workflows* it improves.
- Ask clients: *“What predictions are you already making — and how could better, faster ones change your operations?”*

## ✍️ Your Reflections

You noted that the book repeats this concept often — *intentionally*. Like good teaching, it's hammering in a mindset shift:

> “AI isn’t magic — it’s a cheap prediction engine.”

That lens alone can keep you grounded when navigating hype, complexity, or client expectations.
